//! Integration tests for the crate.
//!
//! These all live in a *single* integration test crate, `tests/integration`,
//! because each integration test is a dedicated binary crate which has to be
//! compiled separately. While that is not really a problem for a crate this
//! small, we have chosen to follow this “best practice” here as a good example.
//!
//! For more details on why you might prefer this pattern see [this post][post].

/// to work. However, tests cannot use `async fn`, so to test it, we need to
/// have a non-`async` test function, which then applies the macro to an `async`
/// function in its body, and invokes *that*.
