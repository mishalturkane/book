## Futures and the Async Syntax

Like other languages with async, Rust uses the `async` and `await`
keywords—though with some important differences, as we will see. Blocks and
functions can be marked `async`, and you can wait on the result of an `async`
function or block to resolve using the `await` keyword.

Let’s write our first async function, and call it:

```rust
fn main() {
    hello_async();
}

async fn hello_async() {
    println!("Hello, async!");
}
```

If we compile and run this… nothing happens, and we get a compiler warning:

```console
$ cargo run
warning: unused implementer of `Future` that must be used
 --> src/main.rs:2:5
  |
2 |     hello_async();
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
  = note: futures do nothing unless you `.await` or poll them
  = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default

warning: `hello-async` (bin "hello-async") generated 1 warning
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50s
     Running `target/debug/hello-async`
```

The warning tells us that just calling `hello_async()` was not enough: we also
need to `.await` or poll the future it returns. This raises two important
questions:

- Given there is no return type on the function, how is it returning a future?
- What is a future?

### Async functions

In Rust, `async fn` is equivalent to writing a function which returns a future
of the return type, using the `impl Trait` syntax we discussed back in the
[“Traits as Parameters”][impl-trait] section in Chapter 10. An `async` block
compiles to an anonymous struct which implements the `Future` trait.

That means these two are roughly equivalent:

```rust
async fn hello_async()  {
    println!("Hello, async!");
}
```

```rust
fn hello_async() -> impl Future<Output = ()> {
    async {
        println!("Hello, async!");
    }
}
```

<!-- TODO: check whether the "unused Result" thing has been covered. -->

That explains why we got the `unused_must_use` warning: writing `async fn` meant
we were actually returning an anonymous `Future`. Just like with `Result`, Rust
will let us know if we don’t use a `Future`. It is often a mistake to ignore an
error in an operation your program performed. With a `Future`, it is even more
significant. The compiler also warned us that “futures do nothing unless you
`.await` or poll them”. That is, futures are *lazy*: they don’t do anything
until you ask them to.

The compiler is telling us that ignoring a `Future` makes it completely useless!
This is different from the behavior we saw when using `thread::spawn` in the
previous chapter, and it is different from how many other languages approach
async. This allows Rust to avoid running async code unless it is actually
needed. We will see why that is later on. For now, let’s start by awaiting the
future returned by `hello_async` to actually have it run.

<!-- does not compile -->
```rust
fn main() {
    hello_async().await;
}
```

Oh no! We have gone from a compiler warning to an actual error:

```text
error[E0728]: `await` is only allowed inside `async` functions and blocks
 --> src/main.rs:2:19
  |
1 | fn main() {
  |    ---- this is not `async`
2 |     hello_async().await;
  |                   ^^^^^ only allowed inside `async` functions and blocks
```

This time, the compiler is informing us we cannot use `.await` in `main`,
because `main` is not an `async` function. That is because async code needs a
*runtime*: a Rust crate which manages the details of executing the asynchronous
code, including whether or not to use threads for it, scheduling different async
operations, and so on.

Most languages which support async, including C#, JavaScript, Go, Kotlin,
Erlang, and Swift, bundle a runtime with the language. At least for now, Rust
does not. Instead, there are many different async runtimes available, each of
which makes different tradeoffs suitable to the use case they target.  For
example, a high-throughput web server with dozens of CPU cores and terabytes of
RAM has very different different needs than a microcontroller with a single
core, one gigabyte of RAM, and no ability to do heap allocations.

To keep this chapter focused on learning async, rather than juggling parts of
the ecosystem, we have created the `trpl` crate (`trpl` is short for “The Rust
Programming Language”). It re-exports all the types, traits, and functions you
will need, and in a couple cases wires up a few things for you which are less
relevant to the subject of the book. There is no magic involved, though! If you
want to understand what the crate does, we encourage you to check out [its
source code][crate-source]. You will be able to see what crate each re-export
comes from, and we have left extensive comments explaining what the handful of
helper functions we supply are doing.

For now, go ahead and add the `trpl` crate to your `hello-async` project:

```console
$ cargo add trpl
```

In our `main` function, let’s wrap the call to `hello_async` with the
`trpl::block_on` function, which takes in a `Future` and runs it until it
completes.

```rust
fn main() {
    trpl::block_on(hello_async());
}

async fn hello_async() {
    println!("Hello, async!");
}
```

When we run this, we get the behavior we might have expected initially:

<!-- TODO: paths in the output here! -->
```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello-async v0.1.0 (/Users/chris/dev/chriskrycho/async-trpl-fun/hello-async)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.89s
     Running `target/debug/hello-async`
Hello, async!
```

Phew: we finally have some working async code! Now we can answer that second
question: what is a future anyway? That will also help us understand why we need
that `trpl::block_on` call to make this work.

### Futures

A *future* is a data structure which represents the state of some async
operation. More precisely, a Rust `Future` is a trait; it allows many different
data structures to represent different async operations in different ways, but
with a common interface. Here is the definition of the trait:

```rust
pub trait Future {
    type Output;

    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}
```

`Future` has an associated type, `Output`, which says what the result of the
future will be when it resolves. (This is analogous to the `Item` associated
type for the `Iterator` trait, which we saw back in Chapter 13.) Beyond that,
`Future` has only one method: `poll`, which takes a special `Pin` reference for
its `self` parameter and a mutable reference to some `Context` type, and returns
a `Poll<Self::Output>`. We will talk a little more about `Pin` and `Context`
later in the chapter. For now, let’s focus on what the method returns, the
`Poll` type:

```rust
enum Poll<T> {
    Ready(T),
    Pending
}
```

You may notice that this `Poll` type is a lot like an `Option`. Having a
dedicated type lets Rust treat `Poll` differently from `Option`, though, which
is important since they have very different meanings! The `Pending` variant
indicates that the future still has work to do, so the caller will need to check
again later. The `Ready` variant indicates that the `Future` has finished its
work and the `T` value is available.

> Note: With most futures, the caller should not call `poll()` again after the
> future has returned `Ready`. Many futures will panic if polled after becoming
> ready! Futures which are safe to poll again will say so explicitly in their
> documentation.

Under the hood, when you call `.await`, Rust compiles that to code which calls
`poll`, kind of like this:

<!-- TODO: does not compile -->
```rust
match hello_async().poll() {
    Ready(_) => {
        // We’re done!
    }
    Pending => {
        // But what goes here?
    }
}
```

As you can see from this sample, though, there is a question: what happens when
the `Future` is still `Pending`? We need some way to try again. We would need to
have something like this instead:

<!-- TODO: does not compile -->
```rust
let hello_async_fut = hello_async();
loop {
    match hello_async_fut.poll() {
        Ready(_) => {
            break;
        }
        Pending => {
            // continue
        }
    }
}
```

And in fact, when we use `.await`, Rust compiles it to something very similar to
that loop. If Rust compiled it to *exactly* that code, every `.await` would
block the computer from doing anything else—the opposite of what we were going
for! Instead, Rust internally makes sure that the loop can hand back control to
the the context of the code where which is awaiting this little bit of code.

When we follow that chain far enough, eventually we end up back in some
non-async function. At that point, something needs to “translate” between the
async and sync worlds. That “something” is a *runtime*, a crate which handles
the top-level `poll()` call, scheduling and handing off between the different
async operations which may be in flight, and often providing async versions of
functionality like file I/O.

Now we can understand what is happening in Listing 17-XX. The `main` function is
not `async`—and it really cannot be: if it were, something would need to call
`poll()` on whatever `main` returned! Instead, we use the `trpl::block_on`
function, which polls the `Future` returned by `hello_async` until it returns
`Ready`. Every async program in Rust has at least one place where it sets up an
executor and executes code.

Now, that’s a lot of work to just print a string, but we have laid some key
foundations for working with async in Rust! Now that you know the basics of how
futures and runtimes work, we can see some of the things we can *do* with async.
