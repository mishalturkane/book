The executor from `futures` we used in the previous section is intentionally
quite limited. It works well, but it requires you to set it up yourself, as we
did in the previous chapter, and it it is not tuned for any particular use case.
Accordingly, if you are going to build a real-world application, you will likely
want to use the executor from one of the *other* runtimes in the Rust
ecosystem. Once again, we will use code from the `trpl` crate to set things up.

This time, it uses a macro, `async_main`, which allows us to use `async fn` with
a `main` function. The macro just rewrites the function to do something similar
to what we wrote by hand in the previous chapter, but lets us skip writing it
out by hand. Now we can write that `async` block and `.await` it in `main`:

```rust
use trpl::async_main;

#[async_main]
async fn main() {
    async {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }.await;
}
```

Okay, now let’s start exploring.
